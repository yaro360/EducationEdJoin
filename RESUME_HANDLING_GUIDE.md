# üìÑ Resume Handling Guide

## üéØ The Challenge with Google Forms

**Google Forms Limitation**: Google Forms can only handle file uploads in specific scenarios and has size limits. For professional resume handling, we need alternative approaches.

## üöÄ Best Solutions for Resume Handling

4. You can access resumes via the provided URL

**Pros:**

- ‚úÖ Works immediately
- ‚úÖ No additional setup required
- ‚úÖ Reliable and fast

**Cons:**

```

```
